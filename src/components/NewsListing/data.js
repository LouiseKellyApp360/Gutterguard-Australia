        "We wanted to drink the water, so we needed to be sure we didn’t have organic matter, like bird waste, entering our gutters. We researched our options and decided Gutterguard Australia was the best way to protect the water from nasty toxins. We liked the BlueScope steel quality, we didn’t want cheap mesh effecting our drinking water.",
      h3: "Gutterguard Australia’s advice on rainwater harvesting",
      p1: "People who harvest rainwater for drinking, will typically go for a 2-step filtration process. Step 1 is setting up gutter guards in their gutter and roof valleys. Larger particles are filtered on the roof, leaving only smaller particles to be collected at step 2, at the rainwater tank. One of the benefits of the 2-step process is people don’t need to clean their rainwater tank filter as often.",
      p2: "Step 1 filters on the roof, trap bigger leaves and twigs, allowing only very fine particles to travel to the tank. This 2-step filtration process is necessary for drinking water, as it stops dead organic matter and toxic waste entering the water. Dead birds, lice on birds, rats and mice poop and bird poop, decaying leaf matter, can all spoil the health benefits of pure rainwater.",
      p3: "At Gutterguard Australia the request for gutter guards to be used for rainwater harvesting grows every year. People not only want the health benefits of harvesting rainwater, they want to conserve and save water.",

        "Our builder told us we needed gutter guard because we were in a fire zone. He recommended Gutterguard Australia Ember mesh because it is the only mesh we can use that won’t void our warranty on our Colourbond roof. We are so pleased we found this out, my brother was not as lucky, he just built a house and his builder recommended a mesh that will void his roof warranty if there are issues.",
      h3: "Gutterguard Australia’s advice on bushfire protection",
      p1: "You don’t need to back on to bushland to be a bushfire risk, embers from bushfires can carry up to 40km, and regularly travel 15kms. If you are in a bush fire zone and are building a new house, it is mandatory to have gutter guard installed. Councils won’t provide you with a certificate of occupancy until it is installed. On older houses, gutter guard is not mandatory but recommended. There are rebates available on the gutter guard installations. Gutterguard Australia’s ember mesh has been specifically designed for houses in fire zones, the finer mesh keeps the gutters cleaner than the standard mesh.",
      p2: "Embers have many entry points, with the most common being the gutter into the roof, blocked gutters are the most common cause of house fires.  If you have bird and rat materials in your roof, it is much more likely to spark in the case of bushfires.",

When we called Gutterguard Australia, they evaluated all the exposure points on the roof and were able to give us the reassurance that they could keep the rats out for good.",
      h3: "Gutterguard Australia’s advice on rats and mice in the rooftop",
      p1: "Possums, rats and mice are very common inhabitants in Australian roofs. In winter, mice and rats come looking for food and warmth and enter the house through the gutter. Corrugated roofs have thousands of entry points for rodents. The roof hip ends for example have enough open space to put your fist inside.",
      p2: "Mice are the most common unwanted freeloaders in your rooftop. During the recent mice plague in Australia, we saw the situation reach an extreme. People discovered blocking the doors were ineffective against mice, mice are nimble and able to climb walls.",
      p3: "If you do get hit by mice or rats, Ratsack, is a good option. When the rats and mice eat it, they become thirsty and go searching for water. They will normally die outside. The best solution is to stop them coming with gutter guards. Every home and every location in Australia is vulnerable, rats and mice are just at home in the city as they are in the country.",

Gutter guards from Gutterguard Australia have given us back 2-3 days a year, as our gutters and roof valleys are now clean. It is a relief that we don’t have to risk getting up so high on ladders, a fall could be serious.",
      h3: "Gutterguard’s Australia’s advice to eliminate the need to clean gutters",
      p1: "Cleaning the leaves, debris and unwelcome birds and rodents from your gutter is not many peoples’ ideal weekend activity. It is a dangerous and time-consuming activity. If you are in a leafy area, you can spend 4 to 8 hours to finish the job and may need to repeat it 2 to 4 times a year.",
      p2: "Gutter guards keeps the leaves and twigs out, their gentle ski slope designs allows gravity to do the work, leaves and twigs are blown to the  ground with wind.",
      p3: "If you are time poor, the risks of leaving the gutters blocked are substantial. When the gutters are full of leaves, storm water push the blockage into the down pipes. This can lead to over a $1,000 fee to get a tradesman with an electric eel to remove the leaves. Leaves blocked in the gutters eventually leads to rust and the weight of water-soaked leaves can cause the gutter to fall away or cause cracks in the gutter and facia.",

I didn’t realise our water and leave clogged gutters would permeate the ceiling. Our Gutterguard Australia installation stopped the ceiling mould turning into something more serious.  Their installers are professional roofers who could reassure us that the damage was not too serious. We were able to restore the roof with a fresh coat of paint and it looked as good as new.",
      h3: "Gutterguard Australia’s advice on eliminating gutter related mould",
      p1: "Blocked gutters are one of the most common causes of ceiling mould. Mould is a sign that water has entered the roof and it is usually an indicator you may have other issues as well. If the water damage is mild, you may simply have to paint the ceiling, however there may be more serious damage, such as electrical damage or water damaged insulation. If the water damage requires you to replace the insulation and gyprock, the damage could cost you thousands.",
      p2: "Many people have trouble sleeping in mould effected parts of the house and room. Mould can get into your clothes and can cause health issues.

Gutterguard Australia walked me through how they could bird proof my roof and solar system, using gutterguard. We have had it for over a year and now I enjoy sitting outside watching them try and fail to get back in.",
      h3: "Gutterguard Australia’s advice for bird proofing your roof",
      p1: "Starlings and sparrows are all over Australia, they are very effective at taking residence in your roof. They will take one or two years before they inhabit a new home, but when they have become familiar with your home, they will enter. Pigeons are a serious risk to solar panels, and are very messy. ",
      p2: "Starlings and sparrows carry disease, and lice into your home. Cleaning gutters will not stop these birds coming, some houses have hundreds of nests in one roof.  Some people use wire to stop the birds with some success, but the mice can still get in and they haven’t solved the problem of blocked gutters.",
      p3: "Pigeons can also be a problem if you have solar panels. They like to nest and rest under the panels and make a mess around the solar area. Pigeons are a serious risk to solar panels, not only are they very messy. This mess can cause the solar panels to heat up and eventually ignite into a fire. Gutterguard Australia can bird proof your solar panels using our mesh and solar clips around the panels.",

      h3: "Gutterguard Australia’s advice to stop gutter-related electrical damage",
      p1: "Gutter related electrical damage is not uncommon and comes from three key sources; water damage, mice and rats chewing the cabling and to a lesser degree from birds which nest around lights. ",
      p2: "Electrical damage from water coming into lights, roof and insulation, can even lead to gyprock replacement and impact cabling within walls. If you need to replace electrical cables due to water damage, it typically coincides with insulation replacement and even gyprock replacement, it is a bill that could run into the thousands. When water gets into the insulation, it damages the electrical system and it shuts off light switches at the mains.",
      p3: "Rats can easily chew through cables. When rats and mice come into your roof, they make their nest around the electricals. They are attracted to its warmth. Their nests can easily make the cables overheat and cause an electrical fire. When they make their nest around the electrical cables they like to nibble on the cable. This leads to the need to patch bitten areas and the bills can be excessive.",

      h3: "Gutterguard Australia’s advice to prevent water damage rotting your home.",
      p1: "When working properly, gutters direct the water away from your house, when they are blocked, they act as a sponge. When water does not get away, it will, over the years, cause the rotting to expand into the house. When the gutters are waterlogged, water comes in, and damages the eaves and the timbers. In the case of corrugated roofs, the whole roof can corrode, for tile roofs the gutters and down pipes are vulnerable.",
