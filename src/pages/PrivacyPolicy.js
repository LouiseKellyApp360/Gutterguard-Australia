          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. When we collect personal information</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will only collect your personal information where:
            <ul>
              <li>
                it is reasonably necessary for us to pursue one or more of our
                functions or activities; or
              </li>
              <li>we are required to by law.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Some personal information (e.g. race, ethnicity, health information
            etc.) is sensitive and requires a higher level of protection under
            the Privacy Act. We will only collect such sensitive information
            when:
            <ul>
              <li>we have your consent; and</li>
              <li>
                the collection is reasonably necessary for us to pursue one or
                more of our functions or activities.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            We will not need your consent to collect your sensitive information
            when it is required or authorised by law.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. How we collect personal information</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will only collect personal information about you by lawful and
            fair means.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will collect personal information directly from you - for
            example, when you send us an email or complete and submit an online
            form, unless:
            <ul>
              <li>
                you have consented to our collection of your personal
                information from third parties – for example, our related
                companies, credit reporting agencies, or your representatives;
                or
              </li>
              <li>when we are legally required to do so; or</li>
              <li>it is unreasonable or impractical to do so.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If we receive unsolicited personal information about or relating to
            you and we could have collected the information if we had solicited
            the information, then we will treat it in the same way as
            information collected under clause 3 and 4 and in accordance with
            the Australian Privacy Principles.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we receive unsolicited personal information about or relating to
            you and we could not have collected that information, and that
            information is not contained in a Commonwealth record, we will, if
            it is lawful and reasonable to do so:
            <ul>
              <li>destroy the information; or</li>
              <li>de-identify the information.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
